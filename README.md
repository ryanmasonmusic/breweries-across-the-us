# breweries-across-the-us

This repo is to provide information about breweries across the United States.  This information about each brewery is provided by Open Brewey DB (https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).  On our webiste all the buttons have a corresponding list that are intinally hidden and as the buttons are clicked, appear or transform back to hidden after each click.  The website provides several buttons to click to preview the list of breweries that are included in the database.  Additionally, the second button prodives what type of brewery it is, such as, a micro brewery/large batch/ or even a brewpub.  The third button includes the state that each brewery resides in.  On the right hand side of the webpage is an additional button that sates to double click.  Once double clicked it will change the sytle property of the background of the entire webpage.  

The buttons also offer a mouseEnter event as well as mouseLeave event, that changes their colors, representing a traffic light, to subtly remind adventures to not drink and drive.  The double click button changes to an orange color to represent the color of most Oktoberfest beers.
